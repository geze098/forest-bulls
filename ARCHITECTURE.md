# Vama Buzau - Booking Platform Architecture

## System Overview

Vama Buzau is a modern booking platform for accommodations, built with a focus on performance, scalability, and user experience. The platform supports three distinct user roles with comprehensive functionality for property management, booking operations, and administrative oversight.

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **Next.js 14+** - React framework with App Router for SSR/SSG
- **TypeScript** - Type safety and enhanced developer experience
- **Mantine UI v7** - Modern React components library
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework (integrated with Mantine)
- **React Hook Form** - Form management with validation
- **Zustand** - Lightweight state management
- **React Query (TanStack Query)** - Server state management and caching

### Backend & Database
- **Supabase** - Backend-as-a-Service platform
  - **PostgreSQL** - Primary database with advanced features
  - **Row Level Security (RLS)** - Database-level authorization
  - **Real-time subscriptions** - Live updates for bookings and notifications
  - **Edge Functions** - Serverless functions for business logic
  - **Authentication** - Built-in auth with multiple providers
  - **Storage** - File storage for property images

### Deployment & Infrastructure
- **Vercel** - Frontend hosting with edge optimization
- **Supabase Cloud** - Managed backend infrastructure
- **Cloudinary/Supabase Storage** - Image optimization and CDN

## Architecture Patterns

### 1. Layered Architecture
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│           Presentation Layer        │
│     (Next.js Pages & Components)    │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│          Business Logic Layer       │
│    (Custom Hooks & Services)        │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│           Data Access Layer         │
│      (Supabase Client & APIs)       │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│            Database Layer           │
│    (PostgreSQL with RLS Policies)   │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- **Database Level**: Row Level Security policies
- **API Level**: Middleware and route protection
- **UI Level**: Conditional rendering based on user roles

### 3. Component Architecture
- **Atomic Design**: Atoms → Molecules → Organisms → Templates → Pages
- **Feature-based organization**: Grouped by business domains
- **Shared components**: Reusable UI components across features

## User Roles & Permissions

### Client (Basic User)
- Property search and filtering
- Booking management (create, modify, cancel)
- Profile management
- Review and rating system
- Booking history and notifications

### Owner (Property Manager)
- All client functionalities
- Property management (CRUD operations)
- Booking oversight and confirmation
- Analytics dashboard
- Review responses
- Revenue tracking

### Administrator
- Platform-wide analytics
- User management and moderation
- Content moderation
- System configuration
- Report generation
- Platform settings management

## Data Flow Architecture

### 1. Authentication Flow
```
User Login → Supabase Auth → JWT Token → RLS Policies → Role-based Access
```

### 2. Booking Flow
```
Search → Filter → Property Details → Availability Check → Booking Creation → Payment → Confirmation
```

### 3. Real-time Updates
```
Database Change → Supabase Realtime → React Query Invalidation → UI Update
```
